# Third-Party Libraries

This directory includes various open-source third-party code that is used by
Quickstep. Some code has been modified slightly to fix build issues or to integrate
with Quickstep. With the exception of the code in the `tmb` and the `protobuf_cmake` 
directories (which are part of the Quickstep project itself), all libraries here 
belong to their original authors and are governed by their respective licenses.
